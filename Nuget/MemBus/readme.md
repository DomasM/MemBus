## 1.2.0 ##

Removed cloning feature from Bus, as it was only partially implemented and does not seem very useful in real life.

## 1.1.2 ##

Fixed bug related to removing and adding subscription where under certain conditions
the subscription will not be picked up for handling a message

## 1.1.0 ##

PublishToken now has a Cancel property. 
If a publish pipeline member sets this to true, all subsequent pipeline members will not be called anymore

## 1.0.4 ##

Added Infrastructure class "DeferredPublishPipelineMember" to separate the time-wise coupling of setting up the bus and being able
to construct an instance of "IPublishpipelineMember"

## 1.0.3 ##

Removal of classes from MemBus that have no direct relationship to the core function of MemBus.
