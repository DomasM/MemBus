## Dependencies ##

Dependencies can be found in the "**lib**" subfolder. MemBus currently has no mandatory dependencies. 
To have more fun with the Observables, it is recommended you use the Reactive framework. The 2 important dlls are **System.Reactive.dll** and **System.CoreEx.dll**, included in the lib

## MemBus as a wrap  ##
MemBus supports OpenWrap. As such, just run `o build-wrap in the directory to get a wrap you can put into your repository of choice.
